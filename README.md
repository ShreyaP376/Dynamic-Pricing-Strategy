Dynamic-Pricing-Strategy

Dynamic Pricing is an application of data science that involves adjusting the prices of a product or service based on various factors in real time. It is used by companies to optimize revenue by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, demographics, customer behaviour and competitor prices. So, if you want to learn how to build a data-driven Dynamic Pricing Strategy, this article is for you. Developed and deployed a state-of-the-art pricing strategy driven by machine learning algorithms, leading to a remarkable 20% surge in average order value for the company's online retail platform.
Utilized historical sales data and market conditions to build predictive models that adjusted prices in real-time

Description:
Implemented a machine learning model that incorporates the provided feature to predict optimal fares for the rides in real time. This model can dynamically adjust prices in response to changing factors. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.


Requirement:
A dataset containing historical ride data has been provided. The dataset includes features such as the number of riders, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status, number of past rides, average ratings, time of booking, vehicle type, expected ride duration, and historical cost of the rides.
